# ngx-http-batcher
Angular (2+) HTTP batching module to reduce the number of HTTP requests and increase performance
=========================

One of the biggest, yet relatively unknown performance boost you will get with modern web applications is to reduce the number of HTTP request you send.  All you need to do is configure the batch endpoint with the library and the rest is taken care of!



```language-javascript
npm install ngx-http-batcher --save
```
